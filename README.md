## ü§ñ Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase for the **Micromouse Summer Project 2025-26**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including code, CAD models, calculations, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.
